**MY FRIENDLY DESKTOP**

DESCRIPTION:
This python application Offers users a seamless and immersive experience by analyzing emotions through webcam and presenting tailored content. The aim of the project is to
develop a student-centric mood analyzer application tailored to address study anxiety. This application utilizes computer vision techniques to detect emotional states,
particularly focusing on stress, anxiety, and relaxation, through facial expressions captured via webcam. By providing personalized support and resources, such as calming
wallpapers, motivational quotes, and relaxation techniques, based on the detected emotional state, the aim is to assist students in managing study anxiety effectively. 

FUNCTIONALTIES:
1. Utilizes computer vision techniques to detect users' emotions or moods through their computer's webcam.
2. Recognizes seven emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Disgust, Surprise, and Neutral.
3. Dynamically sets a wallpaper according to the detected emotion.
4. Displays an interface with a relevant quote based on the detected mood.
5. Incorporates principles of color theory when displaying frames, enhancing the emotional impact and coherence of the visual design.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
1. OpenCV: OpenCV is a powerful computer vision library that provides tools for face detection, an essential component of this application.
2. DeepFace: DeepFace is a Python library for face recognition and facial attribute analysis. We used it specifically for emotion analysis to determine the user's mood based
   on their facial expression.
4. Tkinter: Tkinter is a standard GUI library for Python. We used it to create a simple GUI window for displaying the wallpaper and quote, providing a user-friendly interface.

USAGE:
1. Ensure Python and necessary libraries (OpenCV, DeepFace, Tkinter) are installed
2. haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file should be placed in the same directory as the Python script MyFriendlyDesktop.py for proper functioning.
3. Run the script MyFriendlyDesktop.py.
4. Allow webcam access when prompted.
5. The program will analyze the user's mood, set the wallpaper, and display a relevant quote.
